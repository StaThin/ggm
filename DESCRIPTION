Description: This package provides functions for defining 
    mixed graphs containing three types of edges, directed, 
    undirected and bi-directed, with possibly multiple edges.
    These graphs are useful because they capture fundamental
    independence structures in multivariate distributions
    and in the induced distributions after marginalization 
    and conditioning.
    The package is especially concerned with Gaussian graphical
    models (ggm) for
    (i) ML estimation for directed acyclic, undirected, 
    bi-directed and ancestral graph models;
    (ii) testing several conditional independences;
    (iii) checking global identification of DAG Gaussian models with one 
    latent variable;
    (iv) testing Markov equivalences and generating Markov 
    equivalent graphs of specific types.
