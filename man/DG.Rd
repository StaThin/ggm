\title{Directed graphs}
\usage{
DG(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{a sequence of model formulae}
}
\value{
the adjacency matrix of the directed graph, i.e., a square Boolean
matrix of order equal to the number of nodes of the graph and a one in
position \eqn{(i,j)} if there is an arrow from \eqn{i} to \eqn{j} and zero
otherwise.  The dimnames of the adjacency matrix are the labels for the
nodes of the graph.
}
\description{
Defines the adjacency of a directed graph.
}
\details{
The directed graph is defined by a sequence of models formulae.  For each
formula the response defines a node of the graph and its parents. The graph
contains no loops.
}
\examples{

## A DAG
DG(y ~ x, x ~ z, z ~ u)

## A cyclic directed graph
DG(y ~ x, x ~ z, z ~ y)

## A graph with two arrows between two nodes
DG(y ~ x, x ~ y)

## There can be isolated nodes
DG(y ~ x, x ~ x)
