\title{Representational Markov equivalence to undirected graphs.}
\usage{
RepMarUG(amat)
}
\arguments{
\item{amat}{An adjacency matrix, or a graph that can be a \code{graphNEL} or
an \code{\link{igraph}} object or a vector of length \eqn{3e}, where \eqn{e}
is the number of edges of the graph, that is a sequence of triples (type,
node1label, node2label). The type of edge can be \code{"a"} (arrows from
node1 to node2), \code{"b"} (arcs), and \code{"l"} (lines).}
}
\value{
A list with two components: \code{verify} and \code{amat}.
\code{verify} is a logical value, \code{TRUE} if there is a representational
Markov equivalence and \code{FALSE} otherwise.  \code{amat} is either
\code{NA} if \code{verify == FALSE} or the adjacency matrix of the generated
graph, if \code{verify == TRUE}. In this case it consists of 4 different
integers as an \eqn{ij}-element: 0 for a missing edge between \eqn{i} and
\eqn{j}, 1 for an arrow from \eqn{i} to \eqn{j}, 10 for a full line between
\eqn{i} and \eqn{j}, and 100 for a bi-directed arrow between \eqn{i} and
\eqn{j}. These numbers are added to be associated with multiple edges of
different types. The matrix is symmetric w.r.t full lines and bi-directed
arrows.
}
\description{
\code{RepMarUG} determines whether a given maximal ancestral graph can be
Markov equivalent to an undirected graph, and if that is the case, it finds
an undirected graph that is Markov equivalent to the given graph.
}
\details{
\code{RepMarBG} looks for presence of an unshielded collider V-configuration
in graph.

\examples{

H <- matrix(c(0, 10, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 100, 0, 0, 100, 0), 4, 4)
