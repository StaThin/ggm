\title{Representational Markov equivalence to directed acyclic graphs.}
\usage{
RepMarDAG(amat)
}
\arguments{
\item{amat}{An adjacency matrix, or a graph that can be a \code{graphNEL} or
an \code{\link{igraph}} object or a vector of length \eqn{3e}, where \eqn{e}
is the number of edges of the graph, that is a sequence of triples (type,
node1label, node2label). The type of edge can be \code{"a"} (arrows from
node1 to node2), \code{"b"} (arcs), and \code{"l"} (lines).}
}
\value{
A list with two components: \code{verify} and \code{amat}.
\code{verify} is a logical value, \code{TRUE} if there is a representational
Markov equivalence and \code{FALSE} otherwise.  \code{amat} is either
\code{NA} if \code{verify == FALSE} or the adjacency matrix of the generated
graph, if \code{verify == TRUE}. In this case it consists of 4 different
integers as an \eqn{ij}-element: 0 for a missing edge between \eqn{i} and
\eqn{j}, 1 for an arrow from \eqn{i} to \eqn{j}, 10 for a full line between
\eqn{i} and \eqn{j}, and 100 for a bi-directed arrow between \eqn{i} and
\eqn{j}. These numbers are added to be associated with multiple edges of
different types. The matrix is symmetric w.r.t full lines and bi-directed
arrows.
}
\description{
\code{RepMarDAG} determines whether a given maximal ancestral graph can be
Markov equivalent to a directed acyclic graph, and if that is the case, it
finds a directed acyclic graph that is Markov equivalent to the given graph.
}
\details{
\code{RepMarDAG} first looks whether the subgraph induced by full lines is
chordal and whether there is a minimal collider path or cycle of length 4 in
graph.
