\title{All edges of a graph}
\usage{
allEdges(amat)
}
\arguments{
\item{amat}{a square Boolean matrix, with dimnames, the adjacency matrix of
a graph.}
}
\value{
a matrix with two columns. Each row of the matrix is a pair of
indices indicating an edge of the graph. If the graph is undirected, then
only one of the pairs \eqn{(i,j), (j,i)} is reported.
}
\description{
Finds the set of edges of a graph. That is the set of undirected edges if
the graph is undirected and the set of arrows if the graph is directed.
}
\examples{

## A UG graph
allEdges(UG(~ y*v*k +v*k*d+y*d))

## A DAG
allEdges(DAG(u~h+o+p, h~o, o~p))
