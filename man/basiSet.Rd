\title{Basis set of a DAG}
\usage{
basiSet(amat)
}
\arguments{
\item{amat}{a square matrix with dimnames representing the adjacency matrix
of a DAG.}
}
\value{
a list of vectors representing several conditional independence
statements. Each vector contains the names of two non adjacent nodes
followed by the names of nodes in the conditioning set (which may be empty).
}
\description{
Finds a basis set for the conditional independencies implied by a directed
acyclic graph, that is a minimal set of independencies that imply all the
other ones.
}
\details{
Given a DAG and a pair of non adjacent nodes \eqn{(i,j)} such that \eqn{j}
has higher causal order than \eqn{i}, the set of independency statements
\eqn{i} independent of \eqn{j} given the union of the parents of both
\eqn{i} and \eqn{j} is a basis set (see Shipley, 2000). This basis set has
the property to lead to independent test statistics.
